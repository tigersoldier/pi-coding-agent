;;; Commentary:

;; Session and tree browsing for Pilish.
;;
;; Provides two read-only, refreshable, keyboard-driven buffers:
;;   - Session Browser: find, filter, switch, rename, and delete sessions
;;   - Tree Browser: navigate conversation tree, label nodes (like TUI /tree)
;;
;; Session data comes from time-sliced scans of JSONL files on disk,
;; and conversation trees are projected from the linked chat's JSONL
;; session file.  Browsing does not need a live pi process, but the tree
;; shows the last persisted turn, so it can lag an in-flight turn;
;; refresh manually with `g'.  Tree labels are appended out-of-band and
;; fold back into every disk read.
;;
;; Session switching uses menu.el's guarded resume flow.  Renaming the
;; linked current session asks pi to append session_info; renaming any
;; other session appends session_info out-of-band.  Tree navigation
;; guards the linked session, process, and loaded file; computes the
;; target from fresh JSONL data; atomically rewrites an ordinary local
;; session file so the target's ancestor chain ends it (write-temp +
;; rename — the rename is the only step that touches the file); resumes
;; the rewritten file through menu; prefills the input buffer with the
;; target's re-edit text; and dismisses the browser window once the
;; transition settles.  Navigation does not auto-reopen the browser
;; (refresh with `g'); rewinding before the first message points at the
;; chat's fork command instead.

`pilish--browse-session-file-state' so :parentId is the id of
the current last parseable line (never the browser's cached leaf),
which keeps the entry from orphaning the context on the next load, and
the fresh id is checked against every id already in the file (pi's
loader cannot tolerate duplicates — see
`pilish--browse-fresh-entry-id').  When the file does not end
in a newline a separator is inserted first — bytes are never glued
onto a partial line.  PAYLOAD's pairs are encoded verbatim after the
shared :type/:id/:parentId/:timestamp head, so an omitted key stays
omitted (clearing a label relies on that: the load-time fold treats an
absent :label as cleared).

The file is NEVER created: pi's _persist appends per-entry once the
file exists, and its full-rewrite path is an exclusive create ('wx')
that only runs when the file never existed — creating it here would
crash pi's next flush with EEXIST.  So this helper only ever appends
to an existing readable file.  Races: a concurrent pi append between
the read and the write turns our line into a benign sibling (name
resolution is file-order latest-wins and projection filters these
bookkeeping entries), and stale-parent orphans are impossible by
construction.  A session live elsewhere sees the change on its next

TREE is a vector of projected root nodes in the browse node dialect,
LEAF-ID the projected leaf entry id, and MESSAGE an error string or
nil on success — the same shape as the session side's (ITEMS ERROR)
callback.  The third MESSAGE argument lets callers render precise
error states instead of a generic \"no tree\".

The tree comes from the linked chat's session file on DISK —
`pilish-jsonl-project-session-file' — never an RPC get_tree.
Labels appended out-of-band fold back on every disk read, navigation
rewrites this same file, and no process is needed — the state
:session-file key persists after process death.  The tree shows
the last PERSISTED turn, so it lags an in-flight turn; refresh
manually with \\[pilish-browse-refresh].

The buffer's fetch token is bumped here (mirroring
`pilish--browse-load-sessions'); then a missing chat link
reports the link error and a link with no session file yet — or one
naming a path that does not exist — reports the not-yet error, both
synchronously.  Otherwise the read itself is deferred through
`(run-at-time 0 ...)' so the caller's forced redisplay can paint the
loading state first (see `pilish--tree-browser-fetch-and-render':
Emacs runs due 0-timers before redisplaying, so without the forced
paint a single timer hop starves the loading render entirely); then
it runs as one blocking read (a 53 MB worst-case session reads in
~0.6 s, typical files in tens of milliseconds; chunking would
complicate the pure jsonl reader for no UI gain).  A deferred read
drops itself when a newer fetch has bumped the token, and is wrapped
in `condition-case': a nil or garbage read reports MESSAGE \"Session
file is unreadable or not a pi session file: PATH\" instead of
signaling, and a `quit' during the blocking read (C-g against a huge
file) reports \"Session file read was interrupted: PATH\" — `quit'
is not an `error', so without its own handler the callback would
never run and the browser would sit on its loading state forever."

    `pilish--tree-browser-loaded-file' messages \"Pi: Session

    `pilish--browse-transition-refused-p') —
    `--session-transition-ready-p' cannot see one (status stays idle

    \"navigate\" (the second half; reports its own refusal);
 6. a FRESH `pilish-jsonl-read-file' — the browser's cached
    tree can lag the file — else the unreadable message;
 7. a versioned header: version 1 files (no ids) refuse with the
    migrate hint;
 8. `pilish-jsonl-navigation-target': unknown node ids refuse
    with the refresh hint; a nil :leaf-id (the root user message has
    no parent to rewind to) refuses with the fork hint — the chat's
    fork command does that job;
 9. :current-p is the two-way no-op: without :prefill just message
    \"Pi: Already at current position\"; with :prefill (re-editing a
    prompt the file already sits on) prefill, message, and settle —
    no write, no switch in either case;
10. the resume cwd pre-flight (`--session-file-cwd-or-error') runs
    BEFORE any write so its `user-error's surface before the file
    changes;
11. the local atomic rewrite (`--browse-rewrite-session-file') — the
    closing rename is the ONLY call that touches the session file;
    pre-commit local failure messages and stops byte-identically;
12. `pilish--resume-selected-session' (PROC CHAT-BUF PATH) —
    a same-path switch is legal, so the switch rides the normal
    choreography including the transition latch and history reload;
13. the input prefill runs immediately after the resume RPC is
    scheduled (the latch blocks sending until the switch settles),
    against the input buffer captured from the chat BEFORE the RPC;
14. \"Pi: Navigated to PREVIEW\" from the cached tree
    (`--tree-find-node', `--tree-node-preview', truncated to 60;
    \"Pi: Navigated\" without a preview), then
    `pilish--browse-quit-when-settled';
15. no auto-reopen of the browser — refresh with `g'.

On ordinary local files this guard/read/rewrite path is synchronous and
does not yield back to Emacs, so only an independent writer can stale
the file between checks.  The ready guard idles the linked pi process
but cannot exclude another pi instance or external writer; such a
writer between the authoritative line read and rename can lose its
change.  TRAMP file handlers may yield, and their rename need not be
atomic.  These residual risks are accepted here rather than inventing
cross-module writer coordination."

LINES is the `pilish-jsonl-navigation-lines' vector; the
joined bytes gain one final LF.  The ONLY call that touches PATH is
the closing `rename-file': bytes land without coding or end-of-line
conversion in a sibling temp file (`.pi-nav-…' in PATH's directory)
that carries PATH's modes best-effort, then replace PATH.  On ordinary
local files the sibling is on the same filesystem and rename is the
atomic commit; pi holds no persistent descriptor on session files, so
its next append/read opens the replacement.  On TRAMP a handler may
degrade rename to copy+delete: replacement can be visible in pieces
and a remote failure cannot promise a byte-identical original.  This
is accepted because in-place writing is strictly worse.

The rewrite reorders complete raw lines only.  It always adds one final
LF; CR bytes returned for CRLF lines remain in place, so an all-CRLF
file with its final delimiter stays all-CRLF.  A file missing its
trailing newline gains LF (or CRLF when its final raw line ends in CR).
The ready guard only idles the linked pi process: an independent
append/change between the
fresh line read and local rename can still be lost.  `unwind-protect'
removes the temp on an error or quit before commit.  Thus on ordinary
local files pre-commit failures leave PATH byte-identical and no temp
behind; errors report \"Pi: Navigate failed: …\" and return nil, while quits
propagate after cleanup.  Success returns non-nil."

The tree is read from the linked chat's session file on disk, so no
live pi process is required.  The callback reports (TREE LEAF-ID
MESSAGE): a non-nil MESSAGE renders as an error state with a zero
visible count.  On success, `pilish--tree-browser-loaded-file'
records the file resolved before the deferred read, so a chat session
switch mid-read leaves the label and navigation guards comparing
against the tree actually displayed; it is nil on error states.

The point anchor is captured before the loading-state render — that
render destroys the node sections, so without carrying the anchor
across the cycle the final render would find nothing under point to
restore (see `pilish--browse-rerender-preserving-point').
A refresh issued while another fetch is still loading finds no
sections to capture and reuses the in-flight cycle's anchor (see
`pilish--tree-browser-fetch-anchor').

The loading state is painted EXPLICITLY: the deferred read is a
single `(run-at-time 0 ...)' hop, and Emacs runs due 0-timers before
redisplaying, so without the forced `redisplay' here the loading
render would never become visible (the chunked session scan yields
to redisplay between its slices; one timer hop never does)."
