# Fake pi contract for deterministic frontend tests

This note defines the supported fake-pi surface used by deterministic tests.
The fake is a protocol double for the RPC subprocess boundary, not a mock
of internal Emacs functions. It targets Pi 0.85.0 and later; references to
older releases below are historical comparisons, not compatibility guarantees.

## Scope and seam

The Emacs frontend already has the right seam:

- `pilish-executable`
- `pilish-extra-args`
- `pilish--start-process`
- the real process filter / sentinel / display handler path

The fake must enter through that seam unchanged. Test helpers may bind the
executable and extra args, but production startup code should not grow a
special fake-only branch.

## File layout

- Harness executable: `test/support/fake_pi.py`
- Harness contract note: `test/support/fake-pi-contract.md`
- Scenario fixtures / transcripts: `test/fixtures/fake-pi/`
- Scenario fixture format notes: `test/fixtures/fake-pi/README.md`
- One-off experiments: `tmp/`

The harness should speak strict JSONL on the wire while using a simpler,
more expressive internal scenario DSL.

## Why this fake exists

Two distinct risks need coverage:

1. The Emacs frontend must keep working against a pi-like RPC subprocess.
2. The real pi CLI may drift from the double.

So the fake is for deterministic GUI and integration scenarios, while a
thinner real-backend suite remains as a compatibility backstop.

## Current slow-test value review

### Still boundary-valuable

These are still worth covering at the real subprocess boundary:

- Integration RPC smoke:
  - process spawn / lifecycle
  - `get_state`
  - `get_commands`
  - `new_session`
  - `get_fork_messages`
- Integration prompt lifecycle:
  - immediate `prompt` success plus delayed streamed events
  - `agent_start` / `message_start` / `message_update` / `message_end` / `agent_end` / `agent_settled`
  - idle state after completion
  - persisted message count change
- Integration distinct behaviors:
  - `abort`
  - `steer`
  - session-name persistence through a real session file
- GUI-only regressions:
  - follow-scroll when the window is already at end
  - preserve scroll while scrolled up
  - visible tool rendering / overlay boundaries
  - extension UI round-trips in a real chat buffer

### Already strongly shadowed by unit coverage

These have strong direct coverage outside slow suites and should only stay in
GUI/integration form when they still prove a real boundary risk:

- linked chat/input buffer kill behavior
- many markdown / fence / blank-line rendering rules
- most extension UI method dispatch details
- menu / command list shaping logic after `get_commands`

## Wire-level rules the fake must obey

- Strict JSONL with `\n` as the record delimiter
- Accept optional trailing `\r` on input lines
- Flush each output record promptly
- `prompt` must return an immediate success response before later events
- Ordinary stream events are uncorrelated; `extension_ui_request` carries its
  dialog id
- Responses use `type: "response"` and mirror the request `id` when present
- Unsupported commands should fail loudly with `success: false`

## Supported command surface

The current fake supports:

- `get_state`
- `get_commands`
- `prompt`
- `abort`
- `clear_queue`
- `steer`
- `new_session`
- `get_fork_messages`
- `get_entries`
- `get_tree`
- `get_messages`
- `switch_session`
- `set_session_name`
- `set_model`
- `set_thinking_level`
- `extension_ui_response`

`follow_up` is explicitly rejected.  Conversation navigation/mutation RPCs,
compaction/retry/bash RPCs, session listing, export, and HTML remain out of
scope.

## Supported event surface

Required now:

- `agent_start`
- `agent_end`
- `agent_settled`
- `queue_update` (the empty queue notification from `clear_queue`)
- `message_start`
- `message_update`
- `message_end`
- `tool_execution_start`
- `tool_execution_update`
- `tool_execution_end`
- `extension_ui_request`

The fake does not need `turn_start`, `turn_end`, retry, compaction, or other
higher-level events until a test genuinely needs them.

## Required fields by surface

### `get_state`

Fields the current Emacs code or assertions actively read:

- `model` (the fake model advertises `input: ["text", "image"]`)
- `thinkingLevel`
- `isStreaming`
- `isCompacting`
- `sessionId`
- `sessionFile`
- `messageCount`
- `pendingMessageCount`

Useful for fidelity but not currently required by the Emacs frontend:

- `sessionName`
- `steeringMode`
- `followUpMode`
- `autoCompactionEnabled`

### `get_commands`

Required shape:

- response `data.commands` must be a JSON array
- each command used by assertions needs at least:
  - `name`
  - `source`

`description` may be omitted unless a test needs it.  Command
metadata uses `sourceInfo` with `scope` and `path` sub-fields.
The Emacs normalizer lifts these to top-level `:location` and `:path`.

### `prompt` happy path

Required behavior:

1. send success response immediately
2. later emit `agent_start`
3. emit `message_start`
4. emit one or more `message_update` events with
   `assistantMessageEvent.type: "text_delta"`
5. emit `message_end`
6. emit `agent_end`
7. expose idle state and emit `agent_settled` only after all continuations finish
8. persist enough session data to back session-file and `messageCount` assertions

`agent_end` is a low-level completion boundary, not permission to send a new
prompt. Consumers waiting for the whole run must wait for `agent_settled`.
Completed tool finalization and cooling in the frontend still happen at
`agent_end`.

A `prompt` may include `images`, which must be a JSON array.  Every item must
be an object with `type: "image"`, nonempty string `data`, and nonempty string
`mimeType`.  The fake validates only this upstream RPC shape: it neither
decodes base64 nor restricts MIME values.  Valid blocks are detached from the
request and persisted/emitted after the prompt's text block in request order.

For `text_stream`, images belong only to the initial user turn; steering is
text-only and image-bearing `steer` commands fail.  `tool_stream` preserves
prompt images on its ordinary user message.  The extension-owned
`extension_dialog` and `custom_message` prompt behaviors reject nonempty image
arrays before reporting prompt success.  No new scenario type is implied.

### Abort and queue clearing

`clear_queue` removes the pending text-only steering message and returns
`data: {"steering": ["removed text"], "followUp": []}` (empty arrays when
nothing was queued). It emits `queue_update` with empty arrays before its
correlated response. The fake does not model a complete queue-update stream.

`abort` waits for the worker to settle before acknowledging. Like Pi, abort
alone does not discard a pending steering continuation: the text-stream
scenario emits the aborted low-level `agent_end`, starts that continuation,
and emits exactly one `agent_settled` after the final run. Sending `clear_queue`
before `abort` prevents that continuation. The existing fake still has one
pending steering slot, not a general follow-up queue.

### Tool execution path

For deterministic GUI and benchmark tests, the fake must emit the current
lifecycle:

1. an assistant `message_start` with pending, empty content;
2. delta-only `message_update` events for `toolcall_start`, optional
   `toolcall_delta`, and authoritative `toolcall_end`;
3. the authoritative assistant `message_end` before execution starts;
4. `tool_execution_start`, optional updates with accumulated `partialResult`,
   and `tool_execution_end`;
5. a correlated `toolResult` message; and
6. the final assistant response before `agent_end`, then `agent_settled`.

Every `message_update` carries cumulative `usage`, and carries neither the
legacy top-level `message` nor nested `partial` fields. `toolcall_start`
carries `id` and `toolName`; `toolcall_end.toolCall` remains authoritative.
The renderer's missing-metadata reconciliation handles incomplete events
defensively; it does not promise support for below-minimum Pi releases.

Required fields currently consumed by Emacs rendering:

- `toolCallId`
- `toolName`
- `args`
- `partialResult`
- `result`
- `isError`

### Fork messages

Required shape and semantics:

- response `data.messages` is a JSON array
- each item is exactly `{ "entryId": ENTRY_ID, "text": TEXT }`
- entries cover every raw user-message record with nonempty text in append
  order, including users on abandoned branches (matching Pi's fork selector)
- `entryId` is the raw session entry id; `text` concatenates textual content
  blocks (or passes through string content)

### Session naming

Required behavior:

- `set_session_name` requires a string, collapses CR/LF runs to one space,
  trims it, and succeeds only when the result is nonempty
- fake writes a real valid v3 session file on disk
- naming appends a complete `session_info` entry with `id`, `parentId`,
  `timestamp`, and `name`
- latest `session_info` wins; whitespace is trimmed and a blank/null latest name
  clears `sessionName`

### Extension UI

Required request methods for current test coverage:

- `confirm`
- `input`
- `select`
- `editor`
- fire-and-forget methods the frontend already handles, especially
  `notify`, `setStatus`, `setWidget`, `setTitle`, and `set_editor_text`

The `extension_dialog` prompt kind drives one round-trip dialog; the
`extension_ui` prompt kind emits a list of fire-and-forget events in order
(optionally followed by one custom message) so the frontend can be exercised
without waiting for a response.

Required response shape:

- `type: "extension_ui_response"`
- matching request `id`
- one of `confirmed`, `value`, or `cancelled`

Timeouts for dialog requests should be explicit scenario data, not hidden magic
constants in the harness. Fast defaults are good for automated tests, but the
manual-debugging path should be able to extend or disable those timeouts from
the CLI so a human can inspect the UI before responding.

## Valid v3 session files and inspection RPCs

The fake creates real temporary files, not invented paths.  Generated files use
strict LF-delimited UTF-8 JSONL.  The switch loader also accepts blank lines and
an optional CR before LF, but every nonblank line must be strict JSON.

### Header and entry invariants

The first nonblank record is exactly one current-version header with this base
shape:

```json
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"SESSION_ID","timestamp":"2026-02-03T04:05:00.000Z","cwd":"/absolute/path"}
```

`id` is nonempty, `cwd` names an existing absolute process-local path without
NUL, and `timestamp` is a valid UTC timestamp in the exact
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ` form.

Every later record is a nonheader entry with the base fields:

```json
{"type":"session_info","id":"ENTRY_ID","parentId":null,"timestamp":"2026-02-03T04:05:01.000Z","name":"Example"}
```

Entry ids are nonempty and unique among nonheader entries.  `parentId` must be present
and is either any string or JSON null.  Parent references need not precede the
entry or resolve, so crafted branches and orphans are supported.  Entry
timestamps use the same strict UTC form.  Generated entries form a linear
chain, use monotonic timestamps, and parent each append to the previous current
leaf.  The current `leafId` is the id of the physically last nonheader entry,
including bookkeeping entries; it is JSON null for a header-only session.

Accepted entry types and required payloads are:

- `message`: `message` object with a string `role`
- `thinking_level_change`: string `thinkingLevel`
- `model_change`: string `provider` and `modelId`
- `compaction`: string `summary`, string `firstKeptEntryId`, and finite numeric
  (non-boolean) `tokensBefore`
- `branch_summary`: string `summary` and string `fromId`
- `custom`: string `customType`
- `custom_message`: string `customType`, boolean `display`, and string-or-array
  `content`; optional `details` is preserved
- `label`: string `targetId` and an optional string/null `label`
- `session_info`: optional string/null `name`

Unknown extra fields are retained.  Unsupported record types, malformed
required payloads, duplicate ids, invalid timestamps, non-v3 headers, and
non-UTF-8 or malformed JSONL make a nonempty switch target invalid.  This
strict switch subset is intentional: Pi 0.84.2 can migrate older versions and
skips some malformed JSONL records, while the fake keeps deterministic
transactional failure for test-crafted targets.

### `get_entries`

The request has no payload beyond optional `since: ENTRY_ID`.  Success is:

```json
{"type":"response","command":"get_entries","success":true,"data":{"entries":[],"leafId":null}}
```

`entries` preserves physical append order and excludes the header.  With
`since`, it contains entries strictly after that raw id while `leafId` remains
the session's current leaf.  `since` must be a string naming an existing entry;
a wrong type or unknown id returns `success:false` with `error` and no `data`.
An empty session returns `entries:[]` and `leafId:null`.

### `get_tree`

Success is:

```json
{"type":"response","command":"get_tree","success":true,"data":{"tree":[],"leafId":null}}
```

Every raw nonheader entry, including `label`, `session_info`, `custom`, branch
summary, and compaction bookkeeping, appears once as a node.  Roots are null,
self-parented, unknown-parent/orphan, or defensive cycle-break nodes.  Roots
keep append order; each child array is stably sorted by parsed entry timestamp,
with append order breaking ties.

Labels are folded over all label records in append order.  The latest nonempty
label for a target adds `label` and `labelTimestamp` to that target's node;
an omitted, null, or empty latest label clears both fields.  Label records
remain ordinary tree nodes.  `leafId` is still the raw physical leaf, not a
projected visible node.

### `get_messages`

Success has this shape:

```json
{"type":"response","command":"get_messages","success":true,"data":{"messages":[]}}
```

The fake walks parent ids from the current leaf with cycle protection, reverses
that chain to active-path order, and excludes abandoned siblings.  It then applies
the latest active-path compaction: emit that compaction summary first, retain
the pre-compaction range beginning at `firstKeptEntryId` when present, then
include entries after the compaction.

Projection semantics are:

- `message` contributes its `message` payload; like Pi 0.84.2, a user,
  assistant, or tool-result payload with null/missing `content` gets `content:[]`
- `custom_message` contributes role `custom` with `customType`, `content`,
  `display`, optional `details`, and the entry timestamp converted to Unix
  milliseconds
- a nonempty `branch_summary` contributes role `branchSummary` with `summary`,
  `fromId`, and millisecond timestamp
- `compaction` contributes role `compactionSummary` with `summary`,
  `tokensBefore`, and millisecond timestamp
- labels, session info, raw `custom`, model changes, and thinking-level changes
  contribute no message

`get_state.messageCount` is the length of this same projected message array.
A header-only session returns `messages:[]`.

### `switch_session`

The request must carry a nonempty, NUL-free absolute string `sessionPath`.
This is the frontend-facing subset: Pi 0.84.2 also resolves relative paths,
but the Emacs switch choreography always sends an absolute process-local path.
A successful switch returns:

```json
{"type":"response","command":"switch_session","success":true,"data":{"cancelled":false}}
```

An existing nonempty target is fully parsed and validated as v3 before the
current run is stopped or any in-memory session state changes.  On success the
fake installs the target's raw entries, current leaf, projected messages, all
raw fork users, latest name, id, path, and projected message count.  Switching
to the same path reloads after stopping an active run so an authoritative
aborted append is not lost.

Invalid targets return `success:false` with `error` and no `data`: this includes
non-string, relative, empty-string, or NUL paths; directories or non-regular files; and
nonempty malformed or invalid-v3 files.  Such failures are transactional: the
current session state and active worker remain unchanged.

A deliberate deterministic initialization rule supports resume edge tests: a
nonexistent absolute target and an existing zero-byte regular file are
materialized as a valid header-only v3 session, then selected.  Missing parent
directories are created.  The result has empty entries/tree/messages, null
leaf, no session name, and message count zero.  This is not exact Pi 0.84.2
startup behavior: Pi materializes an existing empty file but leaves a missing
file absent until later persistence, and runtime setup may append a thinking
level entry.  The fake's header-only result is the bounded edge-test contract.

## Backend helper API

Keep backend choice explicit in tests.

The shared helper returns a backend plist with:

- backend symbol: `real` or `fake`
- backend label for failure output
- executable command list
- extra args
- optional fake scenario name

The important design point is visibility: a failing test should say which
backend and which scenario was running.

## Intentionally out of scope

The fake should not try to model all of pi.  Out of scope until a concrete test
needs it:

- full prompt/template/skill expansion fidelity
- conversation navigation, branch creation, and mutation RPCs beyond switching
- compaction command and retry flows (persisted compaction projection is covered)
- bash RPC command semantics
- session listing across projects
- provider/model discovery parity with the real backend
- extension runtime behavior beyond the RPC UI sub-protocol
- every event and field documented in upstream `rpc.md`
