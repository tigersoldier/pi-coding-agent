;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for the optional Evil integration: initial states, keymap
;; registrations, and the copy-raw-markdown default.  All tests are
;; skipped when Evil is not installed.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'pilish)
(when (require 'evil nil t)
  (require 'pilish-evil)
  ;; Requiring `pilish-evil' runs `pilish-evil-setup' at load time,
  ;; which installs global mode hooks.  The suite's default-behavior
  ;; tests (for example kill-ring stripping) must observe the
  ;; non-Evil defaults, so undo the copy-raw-markdown hook; every
  ;; test below re-runs `pilish-evil-setup' inside
  ;; `pilish-evil-test--with-evil', which snapshots the hooks.
  (remove-hook 'pilish-chat-mode-hook
               #'pilish-evil--copy-raw-markdown-in-chat))

;; Mark evil-snipe's hook variables special before any test code runs.
;; `add-hook' in `pilish-evil-setup' gives them global values without
;; declaring them special, so under this file's lexical binding the
;; `let' snapshot in `pilish-evil-test--with-evil' would bind them
;; lexically instead — and loading evil-snipe.elc inside that scope
;; then errors with "Defining as dynamic an already lexical var"
;; when its first real `defvar' executes.  `defvar' on already-bound
;; variables only marks them special, so this is safe either way.
