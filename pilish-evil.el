;;; Commentary:

;; Optional Evil integration for Pilish, modeled on how Evil
;; and Magit cooperate: the read-only chat buffer starts in motion
;; state so navigation keys work unmodified, the input buffer starts
;; in insert state, and `?' opens the transient menu.
;;
;; This file loads automatically when a session is set up while Evil
;; is in use; set `pilish-evil-integration' to nil before
;; loading pilish to opt out.  It can also be loaded
;; explicitly:
;;
;;   (require 'pilish-evil)
;;
;; Loading the file runs `pilish-evil-setup', which is
;; idempotent and can also be called interactively to re-apply the
;; configuration after changing the user options below.
;;
;; Chat buffer (motion state):
;;
;;   n / p   next / previous message (like Magit's section motion)
;;   f       fork session at point
;;   w       copy the shell-local file path at point
;;   TAB     toggle tool/thinking section
;;   RET     visit file at point
;;   i / a   focus input window (append moves to end of input)
;;   ?       transient menu
;;   q       quit session
;;
;; Input buffer (normal state):
;;
;;   RET     send
;;   q       close input window
;;   ?       transient menu
;;
;; Session and tree browser buffers (motion state):
;;
;;   j / k   section navigation (Magit's own, unmodified)
;;   Every   documented browser key — sort, filters, search, scope,
;;          rename, delete, refresh, dispatch, RET — is also rebound
;;          in motion state, because the Evil and evil-collection
;;          keymap stack would otherwise swallow the letters:
;;          evil-snipe owns f/t, evil's motion state owns /, ?, and
;;          the g prefix, and setups that put magit-derived modes in
;;          normal state leave operators waiting on more keys.
;;
;; All bindings are registered with `evil-define-key' on the mode
;; keymaps, so user bindings via the same mechanism take precedence
;; when made after `pilish-evil-setup' runs.

;;; Code:

;; Require the submodules directly rather than `pilish': this
;; file may be loaded while pilish.el itself is still
;; loading, and requiring the top-level feature from here would be a
;; recursive require.

;; builds), and only activates when Evil is present.  Call the

;; macro so byte-compiled output is correct regardless of whether
;; Evil was present at compile time.
