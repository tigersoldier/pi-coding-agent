;;; Commentary:

;; Foundation module for Pilish: shared state, faces, customization,
;; buffer management, display primitives, header-line, and major modes.
;;
;; This is the base layer that all other Pilish modules require.
;; It provides:
;; - Customization options and face definitions
;; - Buffer-local session variables (the shared mutable state)
;; - Buffer creation, naming, and navigation
;; - Display primitives (append-to-chat, scroll preservation, separators)
;; - Header-line formatting and activity phases
;; - Sending infrastructure (send-prompt, abort-send)
;; - Major mode definitions (chat-mode, input-mode)

real session phase change from buffer lifecycle events that merely
reapply or clean up buffer-local UI.
