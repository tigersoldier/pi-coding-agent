;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs frontend for the pi coding agent (https://pi.dev).
;; Provides a two-window interface for AI-assisted coding: chat history
;; with rendered markdown, and a separate prompt composition buffer.
;;
;; Requirements:
;;   - Emacs 29.1 or later (tree-sitter support required)
;;   - pi coding agent @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent 0.85.0 or later,
;;     installed and in PATH on the host where Pi runs
;;   - tree-sitter grammars for markdown and markdown-inline
;;
;; Pilish uses `md-ts-mode` for its own chat and input buffers;
;; loading it does not change global Markdown file associations.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   M-x pilish                    Start or focus session in current project
;;   C-u M-x pilish                Start a named session
;;   M-x pilish-open-session-file  Open a JSONL session file as live session
;;   M-x pilish-toggle             Hide/show session windows in current frame
;;   M-x pilish-session-browser    Browse sessions (filter, switch)
;;   M-x pilish-tree-browser       Browse conversation tree (navigate, label)
;;
;; Many users define an alias: (defalias 'pi 'pilish)
;;
;; Key Bindings:
;;   Input buffer:
;;     C-c C-c        Send prompt (queues text as follow-up if busy)
;;     C-c C-s        Queue steering (interrupts after current tool; busy only)
;;     C-c C-k        Abort current operation
;;     C-c C-p        Open menu
;;     C-c C-r        Browse sessions
;;     M-p / M-n      History navigation
;;     C-r            Incremental history search (like readline)
;;     TAB            Path/file completion
;;     @              File reference (search project files)
;;
;;   Chat buffer:
;;     n / p          Navigate messages
;;     TAB            Toggle completed thinking/tool section or fold turn
;;     !              Run a Dired-inspired shell command on a strict file target
;;                    (command + dash-options appends it; otherwise use *)
;;     w              Copy the shell-local file path to the kill ring
;;     RET            Visit strict file target at point (tool content,
;;                    plain path, or local Markdown label)
;;     C-c C-k        Abort current operation
;;     C-c C-n        New session
;;     C-c C-r        Browse sessions
;;     C-c C-e        Export HTML
;;     C-c C-c        Compact context
;;     C-c C-m        Select model
;;     C-c C-t        Cycle thinking level
;;     C-c C-y        Copy last message
;;     C-c C-p        Open menu
;;
;; Editor Features:
;;   - File reference (@): Type @ to search project files (respects .gitignore)
;;   - Path completion (Tab): Complete relative paths, ../, ~/, etc.
;;   - Prompt image: Attach one content-sniffed raster image to a direct,
;;     idle, non-slash prompt; the input header shows its name and size.
;;   - Message queuing: Submit text messages while agent is working:
;;       C-c C-c  queues follow-up (delivered after agent completes)
;;       C-c C-s  queues steering (interrupts after current tool)
;;     Image-bearing drafts refuse these busy paths and remain intact.
;;
;; Press C-c C-p for the full transient menu with model selection,
;; thinking level, completed-thinking controls, session management,
;; and custom commands.  Its Session r entry opens the disk-backed
;; session browser, and Context w opens the conversation-tree browser;
;; press ? in either browser to discover switching/navigation, search,
;; filters, renaming, and labels.
;;
;; See README.org for more documentation.
