;; Rendering module for Pilish: streaming chat display, tool output,
;; and fontification.
;;
;; This module handles everything that appears in the chat buffer:
;; - Streaming message display (text deltas, thinking blocks)
;; - Tool call output (overlay creation, streaming preview, toggle)
;; - Event dispatching (handle-display-event)
;; - Streaming fontification (incremental syntax highlighting)
;; - Diff overlay highlighting
;; - Compaction display
;; - File navigation from strict tool rows, plain paths, and local
;;   Markdown labels
;; - Session history display and rendering

Streaming table decoration is comparatively expensive because it queries the

Pi's RPC protocol streams raw argument JSON deltas without a cumulative
assistant message.  This table exists only while the current assistant message

call ID in `pilish--live-tool-blocks'.")

  "Seconds between coalesced renders of streamed text and thinking deltas.
Pi emits one `message_update' per streamed token.  Rendering every token
multiplies markdown/tree-sitter change-hook work by the token rate and grows
quadratically with message size.  Pending deltas are concatenated and inserted
at this cadence, and flushed before any non-delta event, so display order stays
authoritative.  Internal constant, not a user option.")

Each queries tree-sitter over regions that grow with the buffer: the first
records stale multi-line side-effect nodes, the other two scan the
blank-line-delimited block for link-reference and fence structure.  Coupled
to md-ts internals: if md-ts renames them, streaming suspension silently
degrades to running them (correct, only slower).

`md-ts--font-lock-record-dirty-side-effect-bounds' is deliberately NOT in
this list.  It is cheap and keeps md-ts's modified tick and bounded dirty
bounds in sync.  Removing it makes every suspended flush look like an
untracked full-buffer rewrite, so md-ts pushes a full-buffer dirty range on
the next fontification and the dirty-range list grows by one per flush.")

`pilish--md-ts-expensive-change-hook-p' for coalesced streaming flushes (md-ts
keeps its cheap dirty-tick bookkeeping, so repeated suspended inserts do not
accumulate full-buffer dirty ranges).

Use a short-lived independent `markdown-inline' parser so raw, fontified, and
streaming buffers have identical semantics.  Query captures are reduced to the
single semantic owner at point before projecting only that owner's label.  This
keeps deeply nested/recovery trees linear and fails ambiguity closed before
expensive projection.  All node types, bounds, labels, and destinations are
copied to a plist before deleting the parser; no caller observes a tree node
after its parser lifetime.  Installed `md-ts-mode' 0.3 creates its own local
inline parsers lazily during fontification and exposes no public link resolver.

This distinction prevents an owned non-file or malformed link from falling

A missing/ambiguous canonical host or any tree/query/node failure signals
`pilish-semantic-link-parser-error'; parser failure is never semantic
absence.  Only a complete canonical inline/table-cell host is parsed, up to
`pilish--max-semantic-link-host-length'; an over-cap host returns
owned-invalid and cannot reach text fallback.  Lookup snapshots parser state,
isolates every preexisting inline overlay md-ts could adopt, and dynamically
disables local range discovery.  It therefore creates no md-ts parser overlays,
